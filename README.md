# Joker ðŸŽ¤

Now you can generate jokes* in the style of your favorite comedian!

### Usage

#### Generating the models

First, you need to acquire transcripts from your chosen comedian. I recommend getting them from scrapsfromtheloft.com. Download a bunch and put them in single directory.

For example:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ hedberg,\ mitch
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 1999_comedy_central_special.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ jeselnik,\ anthony
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 2013_caligula.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 2015_thoughts_and_prayers.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 2019_fire_in_the_maternity_ward.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mulaney,\ john
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 2012_new_in_town.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 2015_comeback_kid.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 2018_kid_gorgeous.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 2018_snl.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ regan,\ brian
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 2007_standing_up.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 2017_nunchucks_and_flamethrowers.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ generate.py
â””â”€â”€ joke.py
```

With that, you need to generate the markov chains. This is done with
```
$> ./generate.py <path/to/directory> <outfile>
```

For example:

```
./generate.py data/regan,\ brian/ brian_regan
```

This will create a model named `brian_regan` and put it in a folder `models`. You will end up with a folder like this:

```
models
â”œâ”€â”€ brian_regan
â”œâ”€â”€ doug_stanhope
â”œâ”€â”€ john_mulaney
â””â”€â”€ mitch_hedberg
```

#### Generating jokes

Now that these are all generated, you can run the models! To do this:

```
$ ./joke.py <path/to/model> <number-of-words>
```

For example:
```
$> ./joke.py models/john_mulaney 4
And if you went to school, cause that â€™s my wife!
I am very small.
He got feminine hips!
She was in Connecticut recently, and I was younger, Oh, me?
$>
```

*not necessarily funny.
